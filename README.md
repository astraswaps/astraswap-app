## **🏛️ Architecture: How AstraSwap is Built**  

AstraSwap is structured into three main layers to ensure a **modular, maintainable, and scalable** architecture:  

### **1️⃣ Services Layer**  
This layer is responsible for **all interactions with the EpicChain blockchain** via its **RPC API**. It handles:  
🔹 Smart contract communication.  
🔹 Token transactions and balance retrieval.  
🔹 Liquidity pool management.  

### **2️⃣ State Management Layer**  
This layer acts as the **data bridge** between services and the front-end UI. It includes:  
🔹 **React Context API & Hooks** for managing global state.  
🔹 **Efficient caching mechanisms** for improved performance.  

### **3️⃣ UI Layer (Components & Pages)**  
This is the **visual layer** of AstraSwap, where all user interactions take place. It includes:  
🔹 **Reusable React components** (buttons, forms, tables, charts, etc.).  
🔹 **Dynamic pages** that display trading, liquidity, staking, and governance data.  
🔹 **Dark & Light mode support** for enhanced user experience.

## **🛠️ Testing: Ensuring Quality & Stability**  

AstraSwap uses **modern testing frameworks** to ensure reliability.  

✅ **Unit Testing** – Verifies each function and smart contract interaction.  
✅ **Integration Testing** – Ensures seamless communication between front-end and blockchain services.  
✅ **End-to-End Testing** – Simulates real user scenarios for a bug-free experience.  

We use **[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)** for writing and executing test cases. To run tests, use:  

```sh
yarn test
```  

> 💡 Make sure to run tests regularly to maintain application stability.

## **🎨 Code Formatting & Styling**  

To maintain **clean, readable, and consistent code**, AstraSwap follows strict formatting guidelines.  

✅ **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)** is used to **automatically format code**.  
✅ **Linting tools** ensure compliance with best coding practices.  
✅ Developers can run the following commands for formatting:  

**Check for formatting issues:**  
```sh
yarn prettier
```  

**Fix formatting automatically:**
